            <h1>Who Am I</h1>
            <p class="first">My passion for technology has been the reason behind my academic and personal interest and it is this that brought me to specialize in cyber security. I am amazed by the advanced systems, from the complex network infrastructures to the security systems implemented. </p>
            <p class="second">In addition to my love of technology, I also love cars and motorbikes.  I love what's under the hood, the historical of these vehicles, and the dedication that goes into getting them quicker and faster. Whether it is modifying the engine or the aerodynamics of a vehicle, I see the same principles of complex systems and problem-solving that I admire in technology.</p>
            <p class="third">The modern car is essentially an on-the-road array of computers, and being aware of its cybersecurity is just as important as being aware of its specs. All these passions in technology, and automobiles are not just something but part of who I am. They shape who I am as a person, my deep love for cars, bikes and computers that helps me know what I want for my future.</p>
